# MyChessBuddy

## This chess engine was made following the tutorial from Eddie Sharicks series "Chess Engine in Python"
## Sharick's tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnYui0e73Rs&t=1924s

## To run the program, run the file Chess/ChessBuddyMain.py
### I, Nicholas Pottorff made several modifications to it, especially in ChessBuddyMoveFinder.py
### I added options to customize and experiment with the aggressive or defensive or defensive playing behavior of the minmax AI, as well as several other features to make the AI feel more "human" to play against.
