# MyChessBuddy

## This chess engine was made following the tutorial from Eddie Sharicks series "Chess Engine in Python"
## Sharick's tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnYui0e73Rs&t=1924s

## To run the program, run the file Chess/ChessBuddyMain.py
### I, Nicholas Pottorff made several modifications to it, especially in SmartMoveFinder.py
### I added options to customize and experiment with the aggressive or defensive or defensive playing behavior of the minmax AI


### To adjust the AI, change the AGGRESSIVE_BIAS global variable in Chess/SmartMoveFinder.py 
### To play against a defensive AI, set AGGRESSIVE_BIAS to -1
### To play against a neutral AI, set AGGRESSIVE_BIAS to 0
### To play against an aggressive AI, set AGGRESSIVE_BIAS to 1
